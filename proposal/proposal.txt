 1. A paragraph or two describing the topic of your application. 
 What is the overall purpose of your application? Who does it serve? 
 Explain at a high level what users will be able to do using your application.

    Our application will modernize the age-old mode of transportation: hitchhiking. 
    It is a carpool application (called HitchHike) that will allow clients to find 
    or create a carpool ride by specifying a date, origin, and destination. The
    results can be filtered or sorted by price, or rating. Drivers can specify a 
    maximum number of seats, as well as a price.

    Users will be asked to create an account that will allow them to search and join 
    an existing carpool, join a waitlist if the group is already full, or create and 
    post their own carpool group (by entering their vehicle, license, and car model). 
    Users can also update their own profile, and message other users that are using 
    the application. These carpool groups can be either private or public, which allows
    Schools and teams to use the system to set up carpools for events. After a carpool 
    ride, users can rate the carpool service, which can be seen by other users on the 
    driver's profile. 

    Admins are able to message users, but cannot join a carpool or make their own 
    carpool groups. Admin privileges include viewing and editing currently registered 
    users, and groups. They can also update, add, and delete user information. 
    Lastly, admins are allowed to intialize and repopulate the database.
